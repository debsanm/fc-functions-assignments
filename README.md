1.  Define a function named CoinFlip that returns "Heads" or "Tails" according to a random value 1 or 0. Assume the value 1 represents "Heads" and 0 represents "Tails". Then, write a main program that reads the desired number of coin flips as an input, calls function CoinFlip() repeatedly according to the number of coin flips, and outputs the results. Assume the input is a value greater than 0.

Hint: Use the modulo operator (%) to limit the random integers to 0 and 1.

Ex: If the random seed value is 2 and the input is:

3

The output is:

Tails
Heads
Tails

The program must define and call the following function:
string CoinFlip()
